# (Unfinished) DDS Support for ImageSharp

Unfinished, I might get around to finishing it, but I don't know.

I dropped this because I only needed to encode and only in a specific format, and I couldn't be bothered finishing this.

Based on the [DDS Programming Guide](
//https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddds/dx-graphics-dds-pguide).
